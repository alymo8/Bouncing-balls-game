# Bouncing-balls-game
A game that lets user control randomly generated objects within a limit

This program gives users a lot of options, the user chooses the limits for the balls' sizes, velocities, and chooses their number, then runs the game. When the game is running, they can stack the balls, pause or quit. And that was a nice first contact between me and GUI.. 

In this picture, the user chose to trace 2 balls' trajectories

In the next picture, the simulation terminates, the  user chose to keep it running till the end
