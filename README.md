# Bouncing-balls-game
A game that lets user control randomly generated objects within a limit

This program gives users a lot of options, the user chooses the limits for the balls' sizes, velocities, and chooses their number, then runs the game. When the game is running, they can stack the balls, pause or quit. And I used JavaSwing to implement my first GUI.

In this picture, the user chose to trace 2 balls' trajectories

In the next picture, the simulation terminates, the  user chose to keep it running till the end

Here, the user chose to stack the balls, they are sorted in an increasing order of size
